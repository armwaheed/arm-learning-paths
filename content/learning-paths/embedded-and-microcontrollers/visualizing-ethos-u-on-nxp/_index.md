draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists new to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), who want to visualize ExecuTorch performance on a physical device.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify suitable physical Arm-based devices for TinyML applications.
    - Optionally, configure physical embedded devices, using macOS.
    - Deploy a TinyML ExecuTorch model to NXP's FRDM i.MX 93 applicaiton processor (board).
    - Observe model execution on a monitor connected to the FRDM i.MX 93 board.

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.
    - A computer running Linux or macOS.
